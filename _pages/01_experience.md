* **Machine Learning Intern**      Knowledge Foundry Business Solutions
    -Developed a multi-modal image recommendation pipeline for apparel classification and ranking. Employed a parallel XceptionNet architecture for multi-task learning and retrieval. Deployed the model using Flask.

* **Software Engineer**
    - System validation of the camera subsystem, pipeline and drivers used in Qualcommâ€™s Windows based MPSoCs.
    - Development of asynchronous UWP solutions using C#/.Net/WMF/Powershell to validate incremental and legacy features across drivers supporting the ISP, VFE, Post-processing blocks and Codecs.
    - Contributed to bug fixes and code reviews(Python) in overlapping functional areas(Graphics/Video/Audio).

* **Systems Engineer**
    - Development of CodedUI based automation tools using C#/.Net/SQL/Powershell to automate the verification and validation of standalone and cloud based system software deployments of Siemens Diagnostic Lab solutions, adhering to the foundational principles of LEAN and Agile SCRUM methodologies.

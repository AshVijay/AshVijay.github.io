* **Research Assistant**  |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; University at Buffalo |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feb 2019 - Present  
    1. Autonomous Driving 
    - Surveyed Sensor Fusion methods for Semantic Segmentation for scene perception.  
    - Processing and fusing terabytes of multi-sensor(Camera/LiDAR/GNSS/AIS/IMU) data for ingestion into predictive machine learning models  
    - Predicting behavior of maritime vessels in complex port scenarios using Neural Processing techniques(GANs/VAEs/LSTMs/Autoencoders).(In Collaboration with Buffalo Automation)  
       
       **Tools**: ROS, FFMPEG, Pytorch

* **ML Intern**  |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge Foundry |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nov 2018 - Jan 2019  
    - Developed a multi-modal image recommendation pipeline for apparel ranking using XceptionNet architecture(Keras)  
    - Performed data collection, cleaning, normalization, imputation and augmentation for data enrichment (Pillow and Pandas)  
    - Wrote pipelines to feed data from custom sources and deployed model using Flask/jQuery/GCP cloud instances  
       
* **Software Engineer**  |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualcomm |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feb 2017 - Jul 2017  
    - System validation of the camera subsystem and drivers used in Qualcommâ€™s latest gen MPSoCs  
    - Development of asynchronous UWP solutions using C#/.Net/WMF/Powershell to validate incremental and legacy features across drivers supporting the ISP, VFE, Post-processing blocks and Codecs  
    - Contributed to bug fixes and code reviews(Python) in overlapping functional areas(Graphics/Video/Audio)  
       
* **Systems Engineer**  |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siemens |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jul 2015 - Aug 2016  
    - Development of CodedUI based automation tools using C#/.Net/SQL/Powershell to automate the verification and validation of standalone and cloud based system software deployments of Siemens Lab Diagnostic Solutions, adhering to foundational principles of LEAN and Agile SCRUM technologies  
    - Provided a heuristic solution for multiobjective optimization of topology and routing in an NP-Hard Job Scheduling problem

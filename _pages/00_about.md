Hey!   

Thanks for stopping by. I'm a grad student in CS specializing in ML. I usually find myself thriving at the intersection between data and software engineer. I enjoy working on real world problems that can be solved with a data-driven approach and am well versed in the trade of data extraction, processing, modelling and visualization.  

Some of the applied areas that I've brushed with include Embedded Systems, Big Data, Image Processing and Computer Vision, Autonomous and Connected Vehicles.

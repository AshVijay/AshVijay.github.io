Created a data processing pipeline to extract and aggregate tweets and articles from Twitter/NY Times specific to the 2017-2018 Influenza Flu season. Wrote MapReduce jobs to discern relevant statistics of selected tags and visualized the analysis using D3.js to monitor real time disease activity using location specific key-words.
